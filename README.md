# Scene props

This repository contains models for manipulation problems.

## Peg in hole
```bash
./peg_in_hole
```
These models are made with OpenSCAD software. By default, all metrics are unitless. Assume that **1 unit equals 1 mm**.

- Re-create models in `meshes` dir with bash scripts.
- Source `*.scad` files are in `src` directory.

## Roadmap
- [x] Fix models rotations (and VCS preview).
- [x] Create scripts for automatic generation of all models.
