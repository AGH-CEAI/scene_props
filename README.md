# Scene props

This repository contains models for manipulation problems.

## Peg in hole
```bash
./insertion_blocks
```
These models are made with OpenSCAD software. By default, all metrics are unitless. Assume that **1 unit equals 1 mm**.


## Roadmap
- [ ] Create scripts for automatic generation of all models.
